**Step 1**

*Clone the repository*

git clone https://github.com/APlayerUnnamed/lime
cd lime/lime
```

**Step 3**

*Create Config*

Create a file named "config.json" in the folder "lime" in the lime directory. (Yes I know it's confusing)

Then once you have [your bot](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) ready put this in your newly created config.json file:

```
{
 "token": "your bot's token here",
 "clientId": "your bot's ID here"
}

```

**Step 4**

Now your bot should be able to run; so in the lime folder run ```npm start``` and you should see ```lime by APlayerUnnamed is ready!```.
